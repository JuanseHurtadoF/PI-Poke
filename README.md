# A modern day Pokedex

As my final project on SoyHenry, a full stack developer bootcamp, I was tasked to develop a fully functioning Pokedex from scratch. I used Express JS to create a REST API, and Sequelize for data management. The user interface is built with React JS and CSS.

To run, create a .env file in the `api` folder with the following content

```
DB_USER=yourPostgresUsername
DB_PASSWORD=yourPostgresPassword
DB_HOST=localhost
```
Then, type `npm install` on the terminal while located on both `api` and `client` folders to install all dependencies.

Finally, type `npm start` on both folders. To avoid bugs, make sure to deploy the API first.
