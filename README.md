# A modern day Pokedex

As my final project on SoyHenry, a full stack developer bootcamp, I was tasked to develop a fully functioning Pokedex from scratch. I used Express JS to create a REST API, and Sequelize for data management. The user interface is built with React, Redux, and CSS.

To run, create a .env file in the `api` folder with the following content:

```
DB_USER=yourPostgresUsername
DB_PASSWORD=yourPostgresPassword
DB_HOST=localhost
```
Then, run the `npm install` command in the terminal while located on both `api` and `client` folders.

Finally, run `npm start` on both folders. To avoid bugs, make sure to deploy the API first. 

Sorry for all the extra steps. Published version coming soon!
